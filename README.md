# Predict_Mammographic_Mass (In Progress)

This project is assigned by Frank Kane in Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python (Udemy Course).

Dataset is from the UCI repository (Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)

Purpose:
Using different techniques in Machine Learning to predict the severity of a Mammographic Mass and comparing the predicting accuracy.

What techniques will be included:
1.Decision tree
2.Random forest
3.KNN
4.Naive Bayes
5.SVM
6.Logistic Regression
7.Neural network using Keras.
